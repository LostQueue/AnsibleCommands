Setting up SSH Keys 


If you generate a new key pair, the old one will be overwritten. To check whether the key files exist, run the following ls command: 

 

If the command returns something like No such file or directory, or no matches found, it means that the user does not have SSH keys 

 

ls â€“l ~/.ssh/id_*.pub 

 

      Keys exist here: /home/yourusername/.ssh/id_rsa /home/yourusername/.ssh/id_rsa.pub 

 

Now that you have an SSH key pair, the next step is to copy the public key to the remote server you want to manage. 

 

The easiest and the recommended way to copy the public key to the server is to use the ssh-copy-id tool. On your local machine type: 

 

ssh-copy-id remote_username@server_ip_address 

 

You will be prompted to enter the remote user password: 

 

Once the user is authenticated, the public key ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub will be appended to the remote user ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file, and the connection will be closed.
