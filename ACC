 Playbooks are a way to send commands to remote systems through scripts
 
     hosts:         \\group of hosts on which the playbook will run\\
     tasks:
         name:      \\yum module is used in this task for installation 
         yum:
             name:
             state:
         -name:     \\service module is used to check if the service is up and running

\\Inventory file contains a list of servers divided into groups for better control for details like IP Address and SSH Port for each host

\\Example of Playbook - for first group of hosts "group1" selinux will be enabled
\\                    - for second group of hosts httpd packages will be installed only if the ansible_os_family is RedHat and ansible_system_vendor is HP
\\ Ansible_os_family and ansible_system_vendor are variables gathered with gather_facts option and can be used like in this conditional example.

hosts: group1
tasks:
    - name: Enable SELinux
      selinux:
        state: enabled
      when: ansible_os_family == 'Debian'
      register: enable_selinux
      
    - debug:
        Imag: "Selinux Enable. Please restart the server to apply changes."
      when: enable_selinux.changed == true
      
      
      - hosts: group2
        tasks:
        - name: Install apache
          yum:
            name: httpd
            state: present
          when: ansible_system_vendor == 'HP' and ansible_os_family == 'RedHat'
